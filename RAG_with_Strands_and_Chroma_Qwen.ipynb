        "\n",
        "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources. Instead of relying solely on the information it was trained on, a RAG system retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and uses that information to generate a more accurate and context-aware response. A RAG agent will have the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Document parser**: Loads documents from a source to markdown (e.g., a text file or PDF).\n",
        "- **Document chunking**: Splits the loaded documents into smaller chunks.\n",
        "- **Embedding Model**: Converts the text chunks into numerical vectors (embeddings).\n",
        "- **Vector Database**: Stores the embeddings and allows for efficient similarity search.\n",
        "- **Retriever**: Queries the vector database to find the most relevant document chunks for a given question.\n",
        "- **LLM Agent**: Takes a user's question, uses the retriever tool to get relevant context, and then generates an answer using an LLM.\n",

When used as a tool for explanation and understanding (high cognitive engagement), it can support learning. However, when used as a replacement for thinking and problem-solving (low cognitive engagement), it significantly impairs skill development.\n",

            "AI assistance produces significant productivity gains across professional domains, particularly for novice workers. Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation - particularly in safety-critical domains.\n",

Junior or novice workers, in particicular, benefit most from AI assistance when writing code. In high-stakes applications, AI written code may be debugged and tested by humans before a piece of software is ready for deployment. This additional verification that enhances safety is only possible when human engineers themselves have the skills to understand code and identify errors.
