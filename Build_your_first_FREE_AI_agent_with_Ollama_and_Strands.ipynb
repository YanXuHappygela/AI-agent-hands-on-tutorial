You can use any model in Amazon Bedrock that supports tool use and streaming, a model from Anthropic’s Claude model family through the Anthropic API, a model from the Llama model family via Llama API, Ollama for local development, and many other model providers such as OpenAI through LiteLLM.\n",

Strands also provides 20+ pre-built example tools, including tools for manipulating files, making API requests, and interacting with AWS APIs. You can easily use any Python function as a tool, by simply using the Strands @tool decorator.\n",

        "An agent interacts with its model and tools in a loop until it completes the task provided by the prompt.In each loop, Strands invokes the LLM with the prompt and agent context, along with a description of your agent’s tools. The LLM can choose to respond in natural language for the agent’s end user, plan out a series of steps, reflect on the agent’s previous steps, and/or select one or more tools to use. When the LLM selects a tool, Strands takes care of executing the tool and providing the result back to the LLM. When the LLM completes its task, Strands returns the agent’s final result.\n",
